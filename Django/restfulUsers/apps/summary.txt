Okay, so like on the other RESTfulUsers app, we've got a couple of possible routes.

GET to /users: calls index(), displays all Users

GET to /users/new: calls new() to render template with a form that sends POST to users/create. This inserts the new user into the db, then redirects to users<id> to show that user when it's done.

GET to /users/<id>/ calls show()

POST to /users/<id> calls update(), changes the relevant data, redirects a GET to users/<id> when it's done.

GET to /users/<id>/destroy calls destroy(), which nukes the relevant user, then redirects to /users

In [3]: Friendship.objects.first().friend.email
Out[3]: u'bigejsmcxnvj'

In [4]: Friendship.objects.create(user=User.objects.get(id=2), friend=User.objects.get(id=7))
Out[4]: <Friendship: Yay, User #2, Name: Kilroy Arbuckle is friends with User #7, Name: Aaron Aablabab!>

In [5]: Friendship.objects.create(user=User.objects.first(), friend=User.objects.first())
