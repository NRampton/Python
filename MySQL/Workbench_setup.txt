Working on OS X:
1. Used Homebrew to install MySQL ("brew install mysql")
2. Started the MySQL server as a system service ('brew services start mysql')
3. Set the MySQL root user's password to "root" (mysqladmin -u root password "root")
4. After opening up MySQL Workbench, open it up. There is a list of MySQL DB connections there.
5. Click on the wrench next to test and configure any given connection (like, in this example, 127.0.0.1 with a port name after it)
6. Test the connection with the button in the lower right of the resulting window. Upon doing so, you'll be prompted for the password you set in step 3.
7. Database files can be imported in a variety of ways, including simply copying and pasting the text of a .sql file, or using the "open" command in MySQL Workbench.
8. Once a file has been loaded and run to create the relevant database, you will have to refresh the list of available databases on the left of the Workbench screen. Then select a particular DB for use by double clicking it in that list, or by running the query command 'USE [databasename]' in the query editor in the center of the screen.
9. Further queries can be run in this query editor, too. Just enter the appropriate query text and click the lightning bolt button or hit command-enter.
